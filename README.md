# **Team Digi-presentation**

### **Goals**

The following exercise is useful to:

💡 better understand the **git flow procedure** 

**☕** to give a little **review** of some **basic javascript topics** 

🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧 and also it helps **to introduce the team members** to each other.

### **Instructions**

1. **One student must create a new repository on github and set the others as collaborators.** 
    
    From main he/she creates a branch called ‘development’ and a file called ‘team.js’ that will be pushed on the new branch (development). The team.js file needs to be initialized with a variable that has as a value an empty array.
    
2. **Each student must clone the repository and make their own local branch.**
    
    Add an object with the following properties within the array:
    
    - name
    - surname
    - age
    - city
    - hobby
    - favoriteFood
    - favoriteVideoGame
    - favoriteFilm
    - favoriteBook
    - petName
    
    **And push the code.**
    
    If someone wants to leave the information empty, use the empty string: ‘’.
    
3. **All the branches have to merge into development following the git flow procedure:**
    - Pull of development
    - Local merge of development into own branch
    - Conflict solving (if needed)
    - Pull request to development
    
    After all members have merged their code to development, they get an array of objects.
    
    It is very recommended doing the merge operation together in a meeting.
    
4. **Now the team has to write some functions to accomplish several tasks:**
    - Print the team in alphabetical order (surname name).
    - Print the team in age order (name age).
    - Print the team middle age.
    - Print who has a pet (name petName).
    - Print who wrote ‘LOL’ or ‘League Of Legends’ as a favorite video game. (name).
    - Print if there are some members with the same name (name).
    
    **Each member takes a task.**
    
5. **Complete the tasks and merge them all into development following the git flow procedure.**
    
    
6. **Merge development into main to present the final code to the tutor.**
